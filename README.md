# Methods of Advanced Data Engineering course Project

This is my open data project for the MADE module at FAU.  
This repository contains (a) a data science project that is developed over the course of the semester, and (b) the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.

To get started, please follow these steps:
1. Create your own fork of this repository. Feel free to rename the repository right after creation.
   The base repository for this work is (https://github.com/jvalue/made-template)

## Project Work
Data engineering project on "How do unemployment rates correlate to educational attainment levels among adults aged 18 and older in the United States from 2017 to 2022?"  
Check [project](project/) folder for more details.

## Exercises
During the semester the exercises were completed using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee).  
You can find the exercise descriptions and a step-by-step project breakdown throughout the semester in [MADE WS2024/25 - Homeworks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rC0BVSpIIcPakSdqeuvlfPfSukBsB6i005hpG4B8UlI/edit?tab=t.0).

### Exercise Feedback
If youâ€™re interested in exploring Jayvee, you can work on the exercises independently and receive feedback on how well your code meets the goals. There was an automated exercise feedback provided using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/exercise-feedback.yml`).  
Start your journey by forking the source repository.
