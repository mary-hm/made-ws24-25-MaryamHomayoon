US crime and Unemployment Correlation

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does unemployment correlate with various types of crime across age groups in the U.S. in recent years?

## Description

Crime rates in the U.S. are a frequent topic of debate, and so are the issues on employment dynamics. 
This analysis wants to find the relationship between unemployment and crime across different age groups, 
shedding light on whether economic pressures and joblessness may drive individuals toward criminal activities. 
By examining this intersection, the study aims to reveal patterns that could help us understand how economic stability affects crime rates, 
potentially offering insights to guide more effective social and economic policies in the U.S.
